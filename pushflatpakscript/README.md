# pushflatpakscript

[flathub](https://flathub.org) is an app store for Linux. This script is used to update [Firefox on flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.mozilla.firefox).

The Firefox description and links found on flathub.org come from [an xml file used by the docker image](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/49011d374b626d5f0e7dc751a8a57365878e65f1/taskcluster/docker/firefox-flatpak/org.mozilla.firefox.appdata.xml.in#11). The screenshots are also referenced by that xml file, but the actual images are stored in [this repo](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/scriptworker-scripts/tree/master/pushflatpakscript/media/screenshots).
